# UAV-simulation-on-Python-Matlab
This repo contains the source code for the simulation of UAV.

So far, this repo only contains Python code, I will upload Matlab code as soon as possible.

## dependencies
**autograd**
This package is only needed, when you run files under `UAV_python_sim/modeling/`.
You can use the following command to install `autograd`
```bash
pip install autograd
```

## Todo
1. add Matlab code
